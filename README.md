## Quickstart

After [creating a new repository from this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=osx-plugin-template-hardhat&template_owner=aragon), cloning, and opening it in your IDE, run

```sh
yarn install && cd packages/contracts && yarn install && yarn build && yarn typechain
```

Meanwhile, create an `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and put in the API keys for the services that you want to use.
You can now develop a plugin by changing the `src/MyPlugin.sol` and `src/MyPluginSetup.sol` files. You can directly import contracts from [Aragon OSx](https://github.com/aragon/osx) as well as OpenZeppelin's [openzeppelin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) and [openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable) that are already set up for you.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import {IDAO, PluginUUPSUpgradeable} from "@aragon/osx/core/plugin/PluginUUPSUpgradeable.sol";
import {SafeCastUpgradeable} from '@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/math/SafeCastUpgradeable.sol';

contract MyPlugin is PluginUUPSUpgradeable {
    //...
};
```

The initial `MyPlugin` and `MyPluginSetup` example comes with unit test, integration test, and test helpers in the `package/contracts/test` folder that you can reuse.

To build and test your contracts, run

```sh
yarn clean && yarn build && yarn test
```

## Project

The root folder of the repo includes three subfolders:

```markdown
.
├── packages/contracts
│ ├── src
│ ├── deploy
│ ├── test
│ ├── utils
│ ├── ...
│ └── package.json
│
├── packages/subgraph
│ ├── src
│ ├── scripts
│ ├── manifest
│ ├── tests
│ ├── utils
│ ├── ...
│ └── package.json
│
├── ...
└── package.json
```

The root-level `package.json` file contains global `dev-dependencies` for formatting and linting. After installing the dependencies with

```sh
yarn install
```

you can run the associated [formatting](#formatting) and [linting](#linting) commands.

### Formatting

```sh
yarn prettier:check
```

all `.sol`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, and `.yml` files will be format-checked according to the specifications in `.prettierrc` file.With

```sh
yarn prettier:write
```

the formatting is applied.

### Linting

With

```sh
yarn lint
```

`.sol`, `.js`, and `.ts` files in the subfolders are analyzed with `solhint` and `eslint`, respectively.

### Setting Environment Variables

To be able to work on the contracts, make sure that you have created an `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and put in the API keys for

- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) that we use as the web3 provider
- [Alchemy Subgraphs](https://www.alchemy.com/subgraphs) that we use as the subgraph provider
- the block explorer that you want to use depending on the networks that you want to deploy to

Before deploying, you MUST also change the default hardhat private key (`PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"`).

## Contracts

In `packages/contracts`, first run

```sh
yarn install
```

### Building

First build the contracts and

```sh
yarn build
```

and generate the [typechain TypeScript bindings](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) with

```sh
yarn typechain
```

During development of your smart contracts, changes can result in altered typechain bindings.
You can remove the outdated build- and typechain-related files with

```sh
yarn clean
```

which will execute `yarn typechain` again. For convenience, use `yarn clean && yarn build`.

### Testing

To test your contracts, run

```sh
yarn test
```

### Linting

Lint the Solidity and TypeScript code all together with

```sh
yarn lint
```

or separately with

```sh
yarn lint:sol
```

and

```sh
yarn lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report with

```sh
yarn coverage
```

### Gas Report

See the gas usage per test and average gas per method call with

```sh
REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

you can permanently enable the gas reporting by putting the `REPORT_GAS=true` into the `.env` file.

### Deployment

The deploy scripts provided inside `./packages/contracts/deploy`

```markdown

│ └── 01_info.ts
├── 10_create_repo
│ └── 11_create_repo.ts
├── 20_new_version
│ ├── 21_setup.ts

```

take care of

1. Creating an on-chain [Plugin Repository](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-repo/) for you through Aragon's factories with an [unique ENS name](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/ens-names).
2. Publishing the first version of your `Plugin` and associated `PluginSetup` contract in your repo from step 1.
3. Upgrade your plugin repository to the latest Aragon OSx protocol version.

Finally, it verifies all contracts on the block explorer of the chosen network.

**You don't need to make changes to the deploy script.** You only have to update the entries in `packages/contracts/plugin-settings.ts`

```
export const PLUGIN_CONTRACT_NAME = 'MyPlugin'; // This must match the filename `packages/contracts/src/MyPlugin.sol` and the contract name `MyPlugin` within.
export const PLUGIN_SETUP_CONTRACT_NAME = 'MyPluginSetup'; // This must match the filename `packages/contracts/src/MyPluginSetup.sol` and the contract name `MyPluginSetup` within.
export const PLUGIN_REPO_ENS_SUBDOMAIN_NAME = 'my'; // This will result in the ENS domain name 'my.plugin.dao.eth'

export const VERSION: VersionTag = {
  release: 1, // Increment this number ONLY if breaking/incompatible changes were made. Updates between releases are NOT possible.
  build: 1, // Increment this number if non-breaking/compatible changes were made. Updates to newer builds are possible.
};
```

and adapt the `build-metadata.json` and `release-metadata.json` in the `packages/contracts/src` directory [according to our guidelines](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-to-guides/plugin-development/publication/metadata).

#### Creating a Plugin Repository & Publishing your Plugin

Deploy the contracts to the local Hardhat Network (being forked from the network specified in `NETWORK_NAME` in your `.env` file ) with

```sh
yarn deploy --tags CreateRepo,NewVersion
```

This will create a plugin repo and publish the the first version (`v1.1`) of your plugin.

Deploy the contracts to sepolia with

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags CreateRepo,NewVersion,Verification
```

This will create a plugin repo, publish the the first version (`v1.1`) of your plugin, and verfiy the contracts on sepolia.

If you want to deploy a new version of your plugin afterwards (e.g., `1.2`), simply change the `VERSION` entry in the `packages/contracts/plugin-settings.ts` file and use

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags NewVersion,Verification
```

Note, that if you include the `CreateRepo` tag after you've created your plugin repo already, this part of the script will be skipped.

#### Upgrading your Plugin Repository

Upgrade your plugin repo on the local Hardhat Network (being forked from the network specified in `NETWORK_NAME` in your `.env` file ) with

```sh
yarn deploy --tags UpgradeRepo
```

Upgrade your plugin repo on sepolia with

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags UpgradeRepo
```

This will upgrade your plugin repo to the latest Aragon OSx protocol version implementation, which might include new features and security updates.
**For this to work, make sure that you are using the latest version of [this repository](https://github.com/aragon/osx-plugin-template-hardhat) in your fork.**

## Subgraph

### Installing

In `packages/subgraph`, first run

```sh
yarn install
```

which will also run

```sh
yarn postinstall
```

subsequently, to build the ABI in the `imported` folder.

### Building

Build the subgraph and

```sh
yarn build
```

which will first build the contracts (see [Contracts / Building](#building)) with

```
yarn build:contracts
```

second the subgraph manifest with

```sh
yarn build:manifest
```

and finally the subgraph itself with

```
yarn build:subgraph
```

During development of the subgraph, you might want to clean outdated files that were build, imported, and generated. To do this, run

```sh
yarn clean
```

### Testing

Test the subgraph with

```sh
yarn test
```

### Linting

Lint the TypeScript code with

```sh
yarn lint
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage with

```sh
yarn coverage
```

### Deployment

To deploy the subgraph to the subgraph provider, write your intended subgraph name and version into the `SUBGRAPH_NAME` and `SUBGRAPH_VERSION` variables [in the `.env` file that you created in the beginning](environment-variables) and pick a network name `SUBGRAPH_NETWORK_NAME` [being supported by the subgraph provider](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/supported-subgraph-chains). Then run

```sh
yarn deploy
```

to deploy the subgraph and check your [Alchemy subgraph dashboard](https://subgraphs.alchemy.com/onboarding) for completion and possible errors.
